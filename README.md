# Python implementation for the eq-3 Max! protocol

### work in progress
Only limited functionality is implemented.

### credits
Big thanks to **Bouni** for reverse engineering and documenting the protocol at https://github.com/Bouni/max-cube-protocol.

Also big thanks to **Ales Zoulek** at https://github.com/aleszoulek/maxcube for providing a Python implementation (which unfortunately doesn't completly work with the current eq-3 Max! protocol).
